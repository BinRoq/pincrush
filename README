An attempt to replicate Apple's PNG Mangler.
This is insane. Apple's using compression methods that stock zlib doesn't even SUPPORT.
Uses a modified Theos, which is why it's not a subproject here.

zlib only supports compression method 8 (deflate).
Apple modified pngcrush to swap/expand PNGs and premultiply alpha (violating the standard),
modified pngcrush's libpng to use some random compression method (not 8. I've seen 5 and 13.),
and modified pngcrush's zlib to actually support those insane compression methods. At least, I think.

Apple's PNG files are nowhere near valid (extra critical chunk with an unknown format, invalid
compression type, premultiplied alpha), but I'm trying to create an open solution for creating them.

"Think different" and all that.
